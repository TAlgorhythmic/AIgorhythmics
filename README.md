# AIgorhythmics
An AI written in rust. This project aims to create a program that resembles a feeling human being by using machine learning.

# This is still in early development!

# Goals for this project
- Modules that emulate normal human senses, like hearing, visual and so on (not all senses of course, unless you know how to make a program be able to perceive taste or smell data lol, contributions are welcomed!)
- I want to emulate a human brain, so no text input parsing and no LLM behaviors, it must learn through experiences and senses data.
- Emotions emulation, with conflicting emotions algorithms, and saving data based on what it "feels". It must be able to decide next steps based on experiences, and avoid repeating actions that resulted in a "bad" experience.


This is only intended to work as an experiment, not for creating some kind of AI that replaces human jobs, although I'll not be the one to prevent that if someone wants to fork this and use it for their own purposes.
